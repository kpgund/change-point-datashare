## Abstract

We present two change-point models for identifying singular changes in movement behavior: a location-based change-point model (LCPM) and a movement metric-based change-point model (MMCPM). This software includes R scripts to: 1) run both the LCPM and MMCPM on telemetry data in a Bayesian hierarchical framework using NIMBLE (mmcpm.R and lcpm.R), 2) generate realistic movement behavior parameters for the simulation study (simulate_data.R), and 3) run both the LCPM and MMCPM on the simulated data (mmcpm_sim.R and lcpm_sim.R). Data and code will be available at https://github.com/kpgund/change-point.
